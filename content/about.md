Hello!

I'm Saransh and I work as a Program Manager at [Oracle](https://oracle.com) on marketing cloud applications that leverage big data and machine learning capabilities. Previously, I worked at EY Ireland's Assurance practice after completing my masters in Computer Science from [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/). I also hold Bachelors in Computer Science from [SRM University](http://www.srmuniv.ac.in/).

I love most things Data Science & Analytics, Product Management, Design Thinking. I'm also excited about the role that technology shapes today's Financial Services (aka. [FinTech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/fintech)).

When I'm not coding or thinking of how to create a better customer experience, I'm discovering wisdom on [Quora](https://quora.com/profile/Saransh-Agarwal-2), writing life experiences on my [blog](/blog/index.html), reading a book on my kindle _(find me on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/saranshag))_ or trying my hands on cooking. I served as VP Public Relations at [Lexicon Toastmasters Club](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/02197304-lexicon-toastmasters). I'm also interested in learning new languages (both Human and Computer) and wish to speak fluent French one day!
