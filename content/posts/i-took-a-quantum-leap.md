excerpt: My experience with an all-online MBA at Quantic School of Business and
  Technology.

Last year, I made a list of goals that I wanted to achieve by 2021. One of the 'nice to haves' was to get another degree- possibly an MBA. Little did I knew that the pandemic would shut the world and most things- including education would go online. After searching for the best, affordable and flexible courses- I had a chat with one of my former batchmates from Dublin about the online MBA he was doing, which is when I made a decision to apply for the [Quantic's mobile- first MBA](https://quantic.edu/mba). 

Fast forward to August 2021, it's been a month I graduated with an MBA and multiple LinkedIn messages later- I decided to write a post about my experiences and advice for future students. If you're reading this, chances are you've thought of applying for an MBA at some point in your career.

### Admission process

The MBA program is suitable for early-career (<7 years experience) people with an undergrad in any discipline and English language proficiency. The program is highly selective and boasts a ~7% acceptance rate. Once you create your profile, you'll be able to preview introductory chapters of each module. A performance in the introductory chapters can boost your profile, so take note! 

After a few days, I was invited to an interview. My interview was scheduled with *Matt Schenck*, EVP at Quantic. It was an opportunity for me to ask questions about the program and know more about the process. I've got to know that not everyone is invited to an interview- but consider it a good sign if you are invited.

Shortly after my interview, I got one of the best email containing the golden letters

> Congratulations! On behalf of all of us at Quantic, I’m so pleased to notify you of your acceptance into the **Quantic MBA - July 2020** class.

Here's a snapshot of my cohort. I suffered imposter syndrome (everyone suffers from it, [here's an article from HBR on how to handle it](https://hbr.org/2016/07/everyone-suffers-from-imposter-syndrome-heres-how-to-handle-it)) when I saw that my class contains a frontline doctor from NHS, a US Army veteran, a Forbes 30 under 30 winner and young entrepreneurs.

### Academics

Gone are the days of traditional environment, where you've to wake up at 6 AM, travel miles to grab the first rows of the lecture theatre so that you can understand what the professor is trying to explain. I also took some of the online courses where there are 200+ students and more than half are sleeping and have their camera turned off. 

Quantic's innovative approach to teaching is very interactive. It's like playing an online game- you can't go to the next module (level) unless you pass the previous level. The bite size learning modules made it so much easier for busy professionals to learn wherever they are in the world. I even took some of the quizzes while I was waiting at the airport's baggage carousel! 

*Tip: Look out for [\#WhereDoYouQuantic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WhereDoYouQuantic&src=typed_query) on social media to see where Quantic students are learning from!*

I was blown away with the interesting projects, some of which were to be done with a group as a part of curriculum. The best thing about it was that you don't need to write 100's of pages and then wait till eternity for evaluation. Instead, Quantic used an innovative  video based, no 'death by powerpoints' approach. Create a few talking points, record a video and send it for evaluation. For modules like Accounting and Finance, a spreadsheet was to be submitted. This was such a simple yet effective solution, and I loved doing my accounting project- a subject that I dread in the past. 

### Student Engagement & Extra Curricular

Quantic has a very good student engagement team and we'd a Slack for our cohort where you can discuss the course, create a club or an interest group. There are numerous events and meetups planned out by the team. A few of them are Book Club, Documentary Club, industry-specific meetups, geography-wise meetups (based on time zones) and AMA (ask me anything) sessions.

Below is a snapshot of the incredible Quantic network, with students and alumni across the globe.
