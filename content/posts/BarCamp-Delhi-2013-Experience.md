April 27, it was a bright and beautiful Saturday morning. Me and my friend [Rahul Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rahul-sharma/66/a34/473) headed to attend BarCamp9 which was organized at SAP Labs, Gurgaon.\
It was really a memorable experience.

**What is a Barcamp?**\
Barcamp is a tech oriented unconference which is organized by the attendees for the attendees. It is an event where people in the tech community come together to share ideas, knowledge, experiences with each other to benefit from the collective wisdom of peers. There are no attendees and no speakers, only participants. Everyone contributes in some way or other.

We reached SAP Labs, Gurgaon by 9AM. We were refreshed by the beautiful campus at Sector 58. Now, it was time to get started :)\
We took our footsteps to the reception, where registration was going on. There, we receive a cool t-shirt!\
The first session we attended was Hybrid mobile application development by [Dhananjay Kumar.](https://twitter.com/debug_mode) It was really a great session. There on we had various sessions on Design Thinking, In- memory technologies, SQL Backup and so on…\
One of the greatest session was by [Saifi Khan](https://www.facebook.com/saifikhan.in) on Open Source Licencing.

The sessions were really brainstorming. It was fun meeting like- minded people from various places. Also, the facilities provided by SAP were very nice!
