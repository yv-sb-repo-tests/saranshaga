Love the early generation Moto phones. Had clean interface (first in class) and rugged design. I used Moto G 1,3 and 5. Still love my Moto G1 experience- fits perfectly in one hand, shock proof and great design. Moto G5S plus is a great phone but it seems to be a bit delicate and large to operate in one hand. I donâ€™t know why manufacturers are pushing screensize to >5 inches when something <5 works like a charm (iPhone with 4.7" feels great).
