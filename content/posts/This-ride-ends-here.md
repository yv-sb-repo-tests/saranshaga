Dear Dublin,

This is a tough one to write! How are ye keepin’? I still remember the rainy August afternoon in 2014 when I landed, jet-lagged from my first fifteen-hour journey. How can I forget the warmth and kindness that your people showed me during my initial days in a strange country, which was never visited by anyone even in my extended family back home? I still remember my first hike at picturesque locations of Howth, Dún Laoghaire and Killiney hill; my first kayaking in Liffey, overlooking you from a different perspective and yeah! my first pint of Guinness, which tastes best in its home.

In the past two years, I’ve learnt a lot about you. The differences between ‘_North Side_’ and ‘_South Side_’, and how it dissipates during GAA at Croke Park, the cacophony in your centre and busking on Grafton Street- that I loved to hate when I had to rush through. It was in you where I had the most interesting and meaningful conversations with taxi drivers.

I’ll dearly miss the _Teddys’_ on a sunny day and walks along the Dún Laoghaire pier. I’ll miss how my boat shoes split climbing up the Obelisk in Killiney, but compensated with the view I got from the top, mesmerising.

I embraced pacing aimlessly over the quays eating my drooling burrito, straight from _Boojum_ and the random thoughts that raced my mind. Each time I walked by, I discovered something new, but I never got to see your iconic _Samuel Beckett_ bridge in motion. The sunsets at the quays were the best moments ever, _Carpe Diem._

Well, the [past few months](/posts/insider-what-s-going-on-jun-aug-16/) have been one of the (most) toughest part of my life, giving me a legit reason to move away. I have left no stone unturned to reverse my decision to leave but circumstances aren’t happy. I couldn’t believe at first, but I’ve lost a generous portion of my body mass and I’ve felt more stressed, depressed and burnt- out than never before. If I look past two years, I just came with a suitcase full of clothes and a curious mind. I never limited myself to people from my country or craved for Indian food. I waited for _Christmas_ and _Easter_ more than I did for _Holi_ and _Diwali_. Although I never planned to _settle_ down, I never thought I’d leave abruptly either. I never regretted my decision of not moving to _Madrid_ last year where I had a chance to do my dream job, instead, I decided to _stay._ I still don’t regret, but it haunts me when I am feeling like stuck in the rut.

My current situation could be summarised by the song ‘[_For You_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Togf-xagTJA)’ by one of my favourite singer-songwriter, _Gavin James_ (a Dubliner):

> Maybe I’ll forget and maybe I won’t\
> I’m stuck in the moment\
> And so far from home\
> Cause lovin’ nobody\
> It’s breakin’ my heart\
> But you’ll never know this\
> Wherever you are
>
> Well maybe I don’t give up easily\
> But I know this is hard to see\
> But I wish time would slow down\
> So I could keep your heart around\
> If I can make you stay another day\
> I’ll wait another day for you, for you…

I’ll miss the lush green, unspoilt countryside, ‘Craic’, fresh food, that ‘blue-eyed’ girl and the friendliness of the people with the sexiest accent in the world. Irish people just don’t realise how damn friendly they are!

However, I won’t miss,

* Running behind bus 47 my entire two semesters
* The agony of finding suitable **and** reasonable accommodation
* 300+ days of rain
* [Queuing up](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/foreign-nationals-join-the-queue-to-work-and-study-in-ireland-1.2752643) for immigration card at 5 in the morning (they’ve got it online this year, my bad).

Goodbye, Dublin. We’re done! I’ve lost my mojo.

The path back from WFIO is hard. I know, I’ve walked it (and still walking).

> I know its a tough road ahead, no doubt! But all I need is a job, so what do I do? I have to find a thing that I was meant to do, work my a\*\* off to get it. I am never going to stop believing, and I won’t quit. In other words, I don’t just want to feel special, I want to be special.

**This ride ends here, or is it?**
