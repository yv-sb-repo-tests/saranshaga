### Education in Ireland/ Immigration advice

In my leisure time, I consult students aiming to study in Ireland and professionals moving to Ireland. Check out my [profile on Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Saransh-Agarwal-2), where I've answered over 100 questions about life in Ireland as an international student and as a professional on a work permit. \
To set up a phone consultation (~30 mins) regarding Education in Ireland, please consider donating in excess of INR 500 to [GiveIndia](https://www.giveindia.org/) and send me an email with the receipt. 

### Let's get in touch!

I live in a leafy neighbourhood in south-side Bengaluru, India. Send me a short, simple, and direct message on [hello@saranshagarwal.com](mailto:hello@saranshagarwal.com?) or fill out the form below and I'll be sure to get back to you.
