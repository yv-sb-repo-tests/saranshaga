### Education in Ireland/ Immigration advice

In my leisure time, I consult students aiming to study in Ireland and professionals moving to Ireland. Check out my [profile on Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Saransh-Agarwal-2), where I've answered over 100 questions about life in Ireland as an international student and as a professional on a work permit. \
To set up a phone consultation (~30 mins) regarding Education in Ireland, [book here](https://imjo.in/RjYx3P). This is chargeable at an introductory price of INR 499 (~USD 6.99) per session. 

### Misc.

I live in leafy area in south-side Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), India. To reach out, email me on [hello@saranshagarwal.com](mailto:hello@saranshagarwal.com?) or fill out the form below.
